Product Requirements Document: TikTok vs GPA Linear Regression Learning Tool
Executive Summary
An interactive web application that teaches linear regression fundamentals to undergraduate students using the culturally relevant example of TikTok usage vs academic performance. The tool guides users through a 7-phase learning journey from initial curiosity to deep understanding of statistical concepts and critical thinking about causation.
Product Goals
