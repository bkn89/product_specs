Product Requirements Document: TikTok vs GPA Linear Regression Learning Tool
Executive Summary
An interactive web application that teaches linear regression fundamentals to undergraduate students using the culturally relevant example of TikTok usage vs academic performance. The tool guides users through a 7-phase learning journey from initial curiosity to deep understanding of statistical concepts and critical thinking about causation.
Product Goals

Make linear regression concepts accessible to students with only high school math backgrounds
Create emotional investment through personally relevant subject matter
Build statistical intuition before introducing formal terminology
Develop critical thinking about correlation vs causation
Provide foundation for understanding ML/AI concepts in their daily digital lives

Target Audience
Primary: Undergraduate students (ages 18-22) taking introductory statistics, data science, or research methods courses
Secondary: High school AP statistics students, online learners interested in data science
User Journey Overview
Progressive disclosure through 7 phases, each unlocking after completion of the previous phase. Estimated total time: 25-35 minutes.
