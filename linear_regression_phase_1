Project Context & Educational GoalsOverall Project Vision
This is Phase 1 of a 7-phase interactive web application designed to teach linear regression fundamentals to undergraduate students (ages 18-22) with only high school math backgrounds. The complete learning journey transforms abstract statistical concepts into intuitive understanding through culturally relevant examples and hands-on discovery.Why This Project Matters

Accessibility Gap: Traditional statistics education often alienates students with abstract examples (car prices, housing data) that feel disconnected from their daily experience
Engagement Problem: Most educational tools present concepts as lectures rather than interactive discovery experiences
Practical Relevance: Students live in a data-driven world but don't understand the algorithms shaping their digital lives (social media feeds, recommendations, academic predictions)
Foundation Building: Linear regression is the gateway to understanding machine learning, but it's often taught as pure math rather than a practical tool for understanding patterns
Target Learning Outcomes (Full Project)
By completion, students should be able to:

Recognize patterns in data intuitively before applying mathematical tools
Understand linear regression as a prediction tool, not just an abstract mathematical concept
Distinguish correlation from causation and think critically about data interpretation
Connect statistical concepts to real-world applications they encounter daily
Approach data analysis with both human intuition and mathematical rigor
7-Phase Journey Overview

Section A: Hypothesis Formation
Anchor ID: #hypothesis-formation
Header Section
<h1>Does TikTok time predict your GPA?</h1>
<p>Before we look at any data, let's see how good your intuition is about human behavior.</p>
Prediction Challenge 1: Relationship Direction

Label: "If we surveyed 1,000 college students about their daily TikTok usage and GPA, what relationship would we find?"
Input: Range slider (-100 to +100)
Labels:

Left (-100): "Strong Negative - More TikTok = Much Lower GPA"
Center (0): "No Relationship - TikTok usage doesn't affect GPA"
Right (+100): "Strong Positive - More TikTok = Higher GPA"


Visual Feedback: Color changes (red ‚Üí gray ‚Üí green)
Live Update: "You think the relationship is [Strong Negative/Weak/etc.]"

Prediction Challenge 2: Confidence Level

Label: "How confident are you in your prediction?"
Input: Range slider (0-100)
Labels: "Just guessing" ‚Üí "Somewhat sure" ‚Üí "Pretty confident" ‚Üí "Very confident"
Visual: Confidence meter with percentage display

Personal Investment

Label: "Quick personal check - about how many minutes do you spend on TikTok daily?"
Input: Range slider (0-300 minutes)
Live Display: "That's about X.X hours per day"
Usage Categories:

0-30: "Light user"
30-90: "Moderate user"
90-180: "Heavy user"
180+: "Very heavy user"



Summary & Transition

Summary Box: Display all predictions in card format
Button: "Lock in my predictions - show me the data!"
Action: Smooth scroll to Section B
Data Storage: Save all inputs to localStorage for later phases

Section B: Discovery Sequence
Anchor ID: #data-discovery
Step 1: Data Introduction

Header: "Here are 10 students from our survey. Each dot represents one person."
Chart Container: 600px √ó 400px (responsive)
Data Points: 10 carefully selected points

User's point: Bright blue (#0066FF), 10px radius, subtle pulse animation
Other points: Neutral gray (#888888), 6px radius


Axes:

X: "Daily TikTok Minutes (0-300)"
Y: "GPA (2.0-4.0)"


Callout: "The blue dot is you - [X] minutes of TikTok daily. Take a moment to look at the pattern. What do you notice?"

Step 2: Interactive Stories

Prompt: "Hover over each student to learn their story..."
Hover States: Tooltip with student profiles:
Light users: "Sarah: 15 min/day, 3.8 GPA - 'I only check TikTok between classes'"
Moderate users: "Alex: 90 min/day, 3.2 GPA - 'TikTok is my study break reward'"
Heavy users: "Marcus: 240 min/day, 2.4 GPA - 'I can't stop scrolling at night'"

Follow-up: "Now that you know their stories, do you see a relationship forming?"

Step 3: Line Drawing Challenge

Header: "Your turn! Draw a line that best represents the relationship you see."
Drawing Tool:

Click and drag to draw line
Real-time preview
Touch-friendly (mobile)
Semi-transparent preview line
"Try Again" button


Encouragement: "Don't worry about being perfect - trust your instincts!"

Step 4: Transition

Confirmation: "Here's the line you drew:" (highlight user's line)
Button: "Ready to see what mathematics would draw?"
Action: Smooth scroll to Section C

Section C: Mathematical Setup
Anchor ID: #mathematical-setup
Motivation Setup

Header: "Here's why making accurate predictions matters:"
Context:
"You're a peer counselor helping students balance social media and academics.

You know that telling people to 'just stop using TikTok' doesn't work - it's popular for a reason, and people won't quit cold turkey.

But students ARE worried about their grades. They want to know: 'How much is too much?'"


Prediction Scenarios

Scenario 1:

"Emma asks you: 'I spend 2 hours on TikTok daily. Should I be concerned about my GPA?'"
Show prediction point at 120 minutes on user's line
"Based on your line, what would you tell her?"


Scenario 2:

"Jason uses TikTok 20 minutes per day and wonders: 'Am I being too restrictive? Could I use it more without hurting my grades?'"
Show prediction point at 20 minutes on user's line



Why Accuracy Matters
"Your advice could really impact their academic success.

If you tell Emma she's fine at 2 hours but she actually should cut back, her grades might suffer.

If you tell Jason he needs to cut back even more when he's already being cautious, you might cause unnecessary stress.

The more accurate your predictions, the better guidance you can give students who want to find the right balance."
Distance Visualization

Visual: Show distance lines from each data point to user's line
Explanation: "Your line is THIS far from each student we surveyed"
Key Insight: "The closer our line is to the students we already know about, the better our predictions will be for NEW students asking for advice."

Transition

Setup: "Math has a systematic way to find the line that makes the most accurate predictions."
Button: "Show me the mathematical approach!"
Action: Smooth scroll to Section D

Section D: Results & Comparison
Anchor ID: #results-comparison
Mathematical Reveal

Animation: Best-fit line draws from left to right (1.5s)
Visual Specs:

User's line: Forest green (#228B22)
Mathematical line: TikTok pink (#FF0050)
Legend: "üë§ Your line" "üìä Mathematical best-fit"


Distance Update: Show improved distances with animation

Comparison Cards

Card Layout: Three side-by-side cards (responsive to stack on mobile)

Card 1: "Your Intuition"
‚úÖ You captured the [direction/trend] really well!
Your line shows you're already thinking like a data scientist!
[Visual: User's line highlighted]
Card 2: "Mathematical Precision"
üéØ Math fine-tuned the angle and position to minimize prediction errors
Both lines tell the same story - you spotted the pattern!
[Visual: Regression line with distance markers]
Card 3: "Personal Position Check"
üìç With [X] minutes/day, you're a [usage category] user
Both your line and math's line suggest students with your usage typically have around [Y] GPA
[Visual: User's point highlighted on both lines]
